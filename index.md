## LAB 4

```markdown
Lab Goals and Outcomes:

1. Create initial Fastify Node.js web server
2. Initialize as a Node.js project folder using Node Package Manager (npm)
3. Add Fastify to project using npm, and test using Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
4. Add git repo, exclude node_modules folder from git, make commits
5. Fix MIME error, test, and commit
6. Add a second route with query parameters, test, and commit

```

### Technologies Used:
- VS Code
- Chrome
- Fastify Node.js web server
- Node Package Manager
- Git Repo
- Terminal

### What I Learned:
In this lab I had to initialize my lab folder as a Node.js project and set up git using *npm init -y* and *git init*. I also had to install the Fasitfy package using *npm fasitfy install --save*. I was able to use fastify to handle GET routes, the first of which would simply output: Hello from Lab 4! while the second route would output the entered first and last name to appear as Hello, (first) (last)! or if there was no input, the output would appear as Hello, Guest!.
